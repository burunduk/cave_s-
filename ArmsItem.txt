Hey, it's me, Sue.<NOD<CLR
I don't remember telling you anything
about us. We came to the island as a
research group.<NOD<CLR
It was me, my Mom, Kazuma, Professor
Booster and a few assistants.
...The Doctor was with us, too.<NOD<CLR
He was supposed to take care of our
medical needs and did, I guess...<NOD<CLR
But that all changed when he found
the Demon Crown...<WAI0020<NOD
That Crown used to belong to the
master of this island--<NOD<CLR
and grants immense magical powers
to the person who dons it. <NOD<CLR
The Doctor knew about it well before
coming to the island. It's the reason
he forced himself onto our group.<NOD<CLR
After he grabbed hold of the crown
that was pretty much it, we couldn't
do anything about it.<NOD<CLR
The only thing we could do was
continue the research of the island
under his command.<NOD<CLR
He seeks to rule the surface using
the island as a flying fortress.<NOD<CLR
From what I can tell, he plans on
attacking the surface with the
enraged Mimiga army.<NOD<CLR
I was able to escape, however,
the other researchers are probably...<NOD<CLR
Of course, he's using the innocent
Mimiga to grow a large quantity of
the red flowers. <NOD<CLR
And once he's ready to attack...<NOD
He's gonna send the Mimiga into a
state of insane rage by feeding
them red  flowers.<NOD<CLR
With his powers from the crown he'll
control them and me, too.<NOD<CLR
If you can get out of the jail,
please look for a hidden safe house
somewhere within the Plantation.<NOD<CLR
If my Mom is still alive then
she'll be there working on a plan
of her own to beat the Doctor.<NOD<CLR
Please, help her as much as you can.<NOD<CLR
Before I forget, the password to get
into the safe house is "yrotS evaC".<NOD<CLR<FL+1024<FRE<MSG
